# Analyze what is wrong with the double dice being equal 
# After analyzing it again, what I have found is that the branching doesn't happen if we have gone to a "if statement and moved something" we just move regardless
# There is a stupid version which I thought. Or we can flag that we have gone into the statement and then go from there?
# have to fix the hit version of dices being equal
# implement dices being equal for turn two


# I think only the dices being equal is left and correcting the odds of things like (1,3) and (3,1). The getting of the odds might go to the levels honestly


# There is some 6...23 which seems fucked up
